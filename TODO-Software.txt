X - Clean up current code
X - Make calibration program to read colors
    - Save the 4 colors to json/text file and load into main program
- Camera placement (and make rightside up)
- How to determine block/ball from center post and corners
    - Use Bounding box to determine which object it is
        - ex squre/ish is a block/ball, and rectanle is corner or center  
        - Can we determine block from ball to help hardware team
    - Detecting lines on the ground
- How to recognize/avoid space hotels and center
- Main loop
    - Spin
    - Find a block and move towards it (We then pickup block)
    - Make 1 full rotation looking for a new block
        - If found go for it
        - If not, maybe go to center and make a lap around it until one is found

- Create a go to home program
- Keep global track of time
    - Maybe have a timer interrupt to get home

- Add color sensor to bottom
    - have it detect which lines it goes over to determine which quadrant it is in based on ordering/color of lines


New FIX:
    Search for all colors, once it gets largest contour, only filter for that color and track it 
    down and once it thinks its a center post, rin forward for x number of seconds
